# the-friendly-planets

If you have a telescope with a camera attached to it, you can take some pictures of Solar System planets and their moons. With multiple pictures throughout a moon's orbit, you can use Newton's Version of Kepler's Third Law to measure the mass of the planet. We often do this experiment in introductory astronomy classes like ASTR1030 at the University of Colorado Boulder.

This code package provides a few simple tools to go from raw astronomical images to easier-to-interpret images that are aligned, cropped, and presented with (relatively) uniform color scales. You can install the code on your own computer if you're comfortable with Python, or run it through an online interactive colaboratory notebook.

To install, simply run `pip install the-friendly-planets` from a command line.
